package security

// This file was redundant as it only referenced existing comprehensive test files:
// - security_monitoring_test.go
// - security_edge_cases_test.go
// - csrf_session_test.go
//
// These original test files are comprehensive and should be run directly.
// This organizational index file has been removed to eliminate redundant skipped tests.
